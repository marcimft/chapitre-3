	abstract = {Clinical measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is often performed to aid diagnosis of hydrocephalus. This review discusses analysis of ICP and its components' for the investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. The role of pulse, slow and respiratory waveforms of ICP in diagnosis, prognostication and management of hydrocephalus is presented. Two methods related to ICP measurement are listed: an overnight monitoring of ICP and a constant-rate infusion study. Due to the dynamic nature of ICP, a ‘snapshot’ manometric measurement of ICP is of limited use as it might lead to unreliable results. Therefore, monitoring of ICP over longer time combined with analysis of its waveforms provides more detailed information on the state of pressure–volume compensation. The infusion study implements ICP signal processing and CSF circulation model analysis in order to assess the cerebrospinal dynamics variables, such as CSF outflow resistance, compliance of CSF space, pressure amplitude, reference pressure, and CSF formation. These parameters act as an aid tool in diagnosis and prognostication of hydrocephalus and can be helpful in the assessment of a shunt malfunction.},

The compartmental model predicts intracranial pressure gradients, blood and CSF flows and displacements in normal and pathological conditions like communicating hydrocephalus. The system of differential equations of first principles conservation balances is discretized and solved numerically. Fluid–solid interactions of the brain parenchyma with cerebral blood and CSF are calculated. The model provides the transitions from normal dynamics to the diseased state during the onset of communicating hydrocephalus.

	abstract = {The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained in the brain ventricles and the cranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces. The mean CSF volume is 150 ml, with 25 ml in the ventricles and 125 ml in subarachnoid spaces. CSF is predominantly, but not exclusively, secreted by the choroid plexuses. Brain interstitial fluid, ependyma and capillaries may also play a poorly defined role in CSF secretion. CSF circulation from sites of secretion to sites of absorption largely depends on the arterial pulse wave. Additional factors such as respiratory waves, the subject's posture, jugular venous pressure and physical effort also modulate CSF flow dynamics and pressure. Cranial and spinal arachnoid villi have been considered for a long time to be the predominant sites of CSF absorption into the venous outflow system. Experimental data suggest that cranial and spinal nerve sheaths, the cribriform plate and the adventitia of cerebral arteries constitute substantial pathways of CSF drainage into the lymphatic outflow system. CSF is renewed about four times every 24 hours. Reduction of the CSF turnover rate during ageing leads to accumulation of catabolites in the brain and CSF that are also observed in certain neurodegenerative diseases. The CSF space is a dynamic pressure system. CSF pressure determines intracranial pressure with physiological values ranging between 3 and 4 mmHg before the age of one year, and between 10 and 15 mmHg in adults. Apart from its function of hydromechanical protection of the central nervous system, CSF also plays a prominent role in brain development and regulation of brain interstitial fluid homeostasis, which influences neuronal functioning.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Measurement of the oscillating CSF flow in the spinal canal (SC) of healthy volunteers and in patients with post-traumatic syringomyelia (PTS) using an optimized MRI protocol as well as to determine whether stenosis induced velocity changes are detectable using MRI. METHODS: In 68 healthy volunteers quantitative studies of CSF flow in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions were performed. First, an optimized sequence was developed and tested in 19 volunteers using four different flow-encoding velocities (4, 8, 12, 16 cm/s). Secondly, the optimized sequence was employed in 49 volunteers to measure the different CSF patterns in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal canals (CSC, TSC, LSC). Part three of the study, in which patients with PTS are being examined is still underway. We measured the maximum velocity (cm/s), the pixel area (mm2), and the stroke volume (ml/s). Using a flow model the velocities prior to and after compression with 5 different power levels were measured at the stenosis and at a distance of 70 cm. RESULTS: A total of 226 dynamic measurements have been performed–so far 76 in the first part (62 = 81.5\% evaluable) and 150 in the second part–using the optimized sequence and optimal flow velocities. A flow-encoding sequence of 12 cm/s was found best in the CSC and one of 6 cm/s in the TSC and LSC. The maximum velocity in the CSC was 0.95 cm/s with the flow being directed caudal and 0.38 cm/s with the flow being directed cranial. In the TSC the values were 4.7 cm/s and 1.65 cm/s and in the LSC 0.96 cm/s and 0.59 cm/s. The highest velocities were found at the TSC, which has the smallest diameter compared to the CSC and LSC. In the 4 patients with PTS, the maximum velocities were between 0.09 cm/s and 0.97 cm/s with the flow being directed cranial and between 0.04 cm/s and 1.03 cm/s with the flow being directed caudal. The stroke volumina in the CSC were between 0.1 and 1.23 ml/s (mean: 0.48 ml/s) and 0.2 and 2.45 ml/s (mean: 0.66 ml/s) in the TSC and in the LSC 0.08 ml/s and 0.67 ml/s (mean: 0.29 ml/s). The results of the flow model studies showed an increase of velocity between 2.06 and 4.94 cm/s (mean: 3.31 cm/s) at the stenosis and 1.1 and 1.33 cm/s (mean: 1.23 cm/s) at a distance of 70 cm. CONCLUSION: Quantitative measurement of the oscillating CSF flow in the entire spinal canal (SC) is possible using an optimized MRI protocol as well as to detect stenosis induced velocity changes. Due to the high interindividual variability in the data of spinal CSF dynamics, further studies are necessary to collect normal data. The detection of movement of CSF in a post-traumatic spinal cord lesion may alter the therapeutic management.},

The overall pattern of brain motion showed caudal motion of the central structures (diencephalon, brain stem, and cerebellar tonsils) shortly after carotid systole, with concurrent cephalic motion of the major cerebral lobes and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. Peak brain displacement was in the range of 0.1-0.5 mm for all the structures except the cerebellar tonsils, which had greater displacement (0.4 mm +/- 0.16 [mean +/- standard error of mean]). Caudal motion of the central structures did not occur simultaneously but progressed in a caudal-to-rostral and posterior-to-anterior sequence, being seen first in the cerebellar tonsils and then later in the diencephalon (hypothalamus). Caudal motion of the low brain stem and cerebellar tonsil was simultaneous with caudal motion of cerebrospinal fluid in the cervical subarachnoid space.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This prospective study was designed to establish the temporal and quantitative relationship between blood flow and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow using a phase-contrast cine MR pulse sequence. METHODS: A cine phase-contrast MR pulse sequence using peripheral gating was used to measure CSF flow direction and velocity. Data were acquired continuously and interpolated into 16 images throughout the cardiac cycle. RESULTS: The timing of systolic CSF flow in the cervical subarachnoid space (SAS) correlated very closely to the brain arteriovenous blood flow difference during the cardiac cycle. This arteriovenous difference was a measure of brain expansion. Aqueduct CSF flow during the cardiac cycle differed from SAS flow in that systolic flow was delayed in comparison with systolic cervical SAS flow. The normal aqueductal oscillatory flow volume was 1.7 +/- .4 mL/min or 0.03 +/- 0.01 mL per cardiac cycle. This represented 14.5\% +/- 3.1\% of the total CSF flow and tissue displacement through the incisura which was 14.5 +/- 2.2 mL/min or 0.22 +/- 0.03 mL per cycle. CSF oscillatory flow volume in the cervical SAS was 39.0 +/- 4.0 mL/min or 0.65 +/- 0.08 mL per cycle. CONCLUSION: CSF flow can be measured. Results in healthy subjects show relatively low oscillatory flow through the aqueduct which is slightly out of phase (delayed) compared with SAS CSF flow.},

The quasilinear hyperbolic system of equations was numerically solved using the two-step Lax-Wendroff scheme. The model's results were in good agreement with pressure and flow data recorded in humans during rest. The model was also applied to the study of autoregulation during arterial hypotension. A close relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and capillary pressure was obtained. At arterial pressure of 80 mmHg, the vasodilation of the pial arteries was unable to maintain CBF at its control value. At the lower limit of autoregulation (60 mm Hg), CBF was maintained with a 25\% increase of zero transmural pressure diameter of nearly the whole arterial network.},

Three-dimensional models of the cervical SSS were constructed based on MRI image segmentation and anatomical measurements for a healthy subject and patient with Chiari I malformation. CFD was used to simulate the CSF motion and compared to the 4D PCMRI measurements. Four-dimensional PCMRI measurements had much greater CSF velocities compared to CFD simulations (1.4 to 5.6× greater). Four-dimensional PCMRI and CFD both showed anterior and anterolateral dominance of CSF velocities, although this flow feature was more pronounced in 4D PCMRI measurements compared to CFD. CSF flow jets were present near the nerve rootlets and denticulate ligaments (NRDL) in the CFD simulation. Flow jets were visible in the 4D PCMRI measurements, although they were not clearly attributable to nerve rootlets. Inclusion of spinal cord NRDL in the cervical SSS does not fully explain the differences between velocities obtained from 4D PCMRI measurements and CFD simulations.},

	abstract = {The fluid that resides within cranial and spinal cavities, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), moves in a pulsatile fashion to and from the cranial cavity. This motion can be measured hy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and may he of clinical importance in the diagnosis of several brain and spinal cord disorders such as hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, and syringomyelia. In the present work, a geometric and hydrodynamic characterization of an anatomically relevant spinal canal model is presented. We found that inertial effects dominate the flow field under normal physiological flow rates. Along the length of the spinal canal, hydraulic diameter was found to vary significantly from 5 to 15 mm. The instantaneous Reynolds number at peak flow rate ranged from 150 to 450, and the Womersle number ranged from 5 to 17. Pulsatile flow calculations are presented for an idealized geometric representation of the spinal cavity. A linearized Navier-Stokes model of the pulsatile CSF flow was constructed based on MRI flow rate measurements taken on a healthy volunteer. The numerical model was employed to investigate effects of cross-sectional geometry and spinal cord motion on unsteady velocity, shear stress, and pressure gradientfields. The velocity field was shown to be blunt, due to the inertial character of the flow, with velocity peaks located near the boundaries of the spinal canal rather than at the midpoint between boundaries. The pressure gradient waveform was found to be almost exclusively dependent on the flow waveform and cross-sectional area. Characterization of the CSF dynamics in normal and diseased states may be important in understanding the pathophysiology of CSF related disorders. Flow models coupled with MRI flow measurements mnay become a noninvasive tool to explain the abnormal dynamics of CSF in related brain disorders as well as to determine concentration and local distribution of drugs delivered into the CSF space.},

	abstract = {Noninvasive measurement of the speed with which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity wave travels through the spinal canal is of interest as a potential indicator of CSF system pressure and compliance, both of which may play a role in the development of craniospinal diseases. However, measurement of CSF velocity wave speed (VWS) has eluded researchers primarily due to either a lack of access to CSF velocity measurements or poor temporal resolution. Here, we present a CSF VWS measurement methodology using a novel MR sequence that acquires unsteady velocity measurements during the cardiac cycle with a time interval {\textbackslash}textless 10 ms. Axial CSF velocity measurements were obtained in the sagittal plane of the cervical spinal region on three subjects referred for an MRI scan without craniospinal disorders. CSF VWS was estimated by using the time shift identified by the maximum velocity and maximum temporal velocity gradient during the cardiac cycle. Based on the maximum velocity gradient, the mean VWS in the three cases was calculated to be 4.6 m/s (standard deviation 1.7 m/s, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.005) during systolic acceleration. VWS computed using maximum velocity alone was not statistically significant for any of the three cases. The measurements of VWS are close in magnitude to previously published values. The methodology represents a new technique that can be used to measure VWS in the spinal canal noninvasively. Further research is required to both validate the measurements and determine clinical significance.},

	abstract = {Modeling of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system in the spine is strongly motivated by the need to understand the origins of pathological conditions such as the emergence and growth of fluid-filled cysts in the spinal cord. In this study, a one-dimensional (1D) approximation for the flow in elastic conduits was used to formulate a model of the spinal CSF compartment. The modeling was based around a coaxial geometry in which the inner elastic cylinder represented the spinal cord, middle elastic tube represented the dura, and the outermost tube represented the vertebral column. The fluid-filled annuli between the cord and dura, and the dura and vertebral column, represented the subarachnoid and epidural spaces, respectively. The system of governing equations was constructed by applying a 1D form of mass and momentum conservation to all segments of the model. The developed 1D model was used to simulate CSF pulse excited by pressure disturbances in the subarachnoid and epidural spaces. The results were compared to those obtained from an equivalent two-dimensional finite element (FE) model which was implemented using a commercial software package. The analysis of linearized governing equations revealed the existence of three types of waves, of which the two slower waves can be clearly related to the wave modes identified in previous similar studies. The third, much faster, wave emanates directly from the vertebral column and has little effect on the deformation of the spinal cord. The results obtained from the 1D model and its FE counterpart were found to be in good general agreement even when sharp spatial gradients of the spinal cord stiffness were included; both models predicted large radial displacements of the cord at the location of an initial cyst. This study suggests that 1D modeling, which is computationally inexpensive and amenable to coupling with the models of the cranial CSF system, should be a useful approach for the analysis of some aspects of the CSF dynamics in the spine. The simulation of the CSF pulse excited by a pressure disturbance in the epidural space, points to the possibility that regions of the spinal cord with abnormally low stiffness may be prone to experiencing large strains due to coughing and sneezing.},

	abstract = {Spinal arachnoiditis comprises fibrous scarring of the subarachnoid space, following spinal trauma or inflammation, and is often associated with syringomyelia. We hypothesised that cord-to-dura attachments could cause transient tensile cord radial stress, as pressure waves propagate. This was tested in a fluid-structure interaction model, simulating three types of cord tethering, with 'arachnoiditis' confined to a short mid-section of the cord. The annular system was excited abdominally with a short transient, and the resulting Young and Lamb waves and reflections were analysed. Radial mid-section tethering was less significant than axial tethering, which gave rise to tensile radial stress locally when the cord was not fixed cranially. Simulated as inextensible string connections to the dura, arachnoiditis caused both localised tensile radial stress and localised low pressure in the cord as the transient passed. The extent of these effects was sensitive to the relative stiffness of the dura and cord. Tensile radial stress may create a syrinx in previously normal cord tissue, and transiently lowered pressure may draw in interstitial fluid, causing the syrinx to enlarge if fluid exit is inhibited. The suggested mechanism could also explain the juxtaposition of syrinxes to regions of arachnoiditis.},

	abstract = {A two-dimensional axi-symmetric numerical model is constructed of the spinal cord, consisting of elastic cord tissue surrounded by aqueous cerebrospinal fluid, in turn surrounded by elastic dura. The geometric and elastic parameters are simplified but of realistic order, compared with existing measurements. A distal reflecting site models scar tissue formed by earlier trauma to the cord, which is commonly associated with syrinx formation. Transients equivalent to both arterial pulsation and percussive coughing are used to excite wave propagation. Propagation is investigated in this model and one with a central canal down the middle of the cord tissue, and in further idealized versions of it, including a model with no cord, one with a rigid cord, one with a rigid dura, and a double-length untapered variant of the rigid-dura model. Analytical predictions for axial and radial wave-speeds in these different situations are compared with, and used to explain, the numerical outcomes. We find that the anatomic circumstances of the spinal cerebrospinal fluid cavity probably do not allow for significant wave steepening phenomena. The results indicate that wave propagation in the real cord is set by the elastic properties of both the cord tissue and the confining dura mater, fat, and bone. The central canal does not influence the wave propagation significantly.},

The model is based on an inviscid theory for the propagation of pressure waves in co-axial, fluid-filled, elastic tubes. According to this model, the leading edge of a pressure pulse tends to steepen and form an elastic jump, as it propagates up the intraspinal cerebrospinal-fluid system. We show that when an elastic jump is incident on a stenosis of the spinal subarachnoid space, it reflects to form a transient, localized region of high pressure within the spinal cord that for a cough-induced pulse is estimated to be 50 to 70 mm Hg or more above the normal level in the spinal subarachnoid space. We propose this as a new mechanism whereby pressure pulses created by coughing or sneezing can generate syrinxes. We also use the same analysis to investigate Williams' suck mechanism. Our results do not support his concept, nor, in cases where the stenosis is severe, the differential-pressure-propagation mechanism recently proposed by Greitz et al. Our analysis does provide some support for the piston mechanism recently proposed by Oldfield et al. and Heiss et al. For instance, it shows clearly how the spinal cord is compressed by the formation of elastic jumps over part of the cardiac cycle. What appears to be absent for this piston mechanism is any means whereby the elastic jumps can be focused (e.g., by reflecting from a stenosis) to form a transient, localized region of high pressure within the spinal cord. Thus it would seem to offer a mechanism for syrinx progression, but not for its formation.},

This is intended as a simple model of the intraspinal cerebrospinal-fluid system. Our approach is based on the classic theory for the propagation of longitudinal waves in single, fluid-filled, elastic tubes. We show that for small-amplitude waves the governing equations reduce to the classic wave equation. The wave speed is found to be a strong function of the ratio of the tubes' cross-sectional areas. It is found that the leading edge of a transmural pressure pulse tends to generate compressive waves with converging wave fronts. Consequently, the leading edge of the pressure pulse steepens to form a shock-like elastic jump. A weakly nonlinear theory is developed for such an elastic jump.},

	abstract = {Coupling of the cardiovascular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) system is considered to be important to understand the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular and craniospinal disease and intrathecal drug delivery. A coupled cardiovascular and CSF system model was designed to examine the relation of spinal cord (SC) blood flow (SCBF) and CSF pulsations along the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS). A one-dimensional (1-D) cardiovascular tree model was constructed including a simplified SC arterial network. Connection between the cardiovascular and CSF system was accomplished by a transfer function based on in vivo measurements of CSF and cerebral blood flow. A 1-D tube model of the SSS was constructed based on in vivo measurements in the literature. Pressure and flow throughout the cardiovascular and CSF system were determined for different values of craniospinal compliance. SCBF results indicated that the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar SC each had a signature waveform shape. The cerebral blood flow to CSF transfer function reproduced an in vivo-like CSF flow waveform. The 1-D tube model of the SSS resulted in a distribution of CSF pressure and flow and a wave speed that were similar to those in vivo. The SCBF to CSF pulse delay was found to vary a great degree along the spine depending on craniospinal compliance and vascular anatomy. The properties and anatomy of the SC arterial network and SSS were found to have an important impact on pressure and flow and perivascular fluid movement to the SC. Overall, the coupled model provides predictions about the flow and pressure environment in the SC and SSS. More detailed measurements are needed to fully validate the model.},

Most of the models reported in the literature do not take into account CSF oscillation during the cardiac cycle and its kinetic energy impact on the brain. We propose a new lumped-parameter compartmental model of CSF and blood flows in healthy subjects during the cardiac cycle. The system was divided into five submodels representing arterial blood, venous blood, ventricular CSF, cranial subarachnoid space, and spinal subarachnoid space. These submodels are connected by resistances and compliances. The model developed was used to reproduce certain functional characteristics observed in seven healthy volunteers, such as the distribution (amplitude and phase shift) of arterial, venous, and CSF flows.

The larger the number of arterial segments in a distributed 1D model, the greater the number of input parameters that need to be estimated. We investigated the effect of a reduction in the number of arterial segments in a given distributed 1D model on the shape of the simulated pressure and flow waveforms. This is achieved by systematically lumping peripheral 1D model branches into windkessel models that preserve the net resistance and total compliance of the original model. We applied our methodology to a model of the 55 larger systemic arteries in the human and to an extended 67-artery model that contains the digital arteries that perfuse the fingers. Results show good agreement in the shape of the aortic and digital waveforms between the original 55-artery (67-artery) and reduced 21-artery (37-artery) models. Reducing the number of segments also enables us to investigate the effect of arterial network topology (and hence reflection sites) on the shape of waveforms. Results show that wave reflections in the thoracic aorta and renal arteries play an important role in shaping the aortic pressure and flow waves and in generating the second peak of the digital pressure and flow waves. Our novel methodology is important to simplify the computational domain while maintaining the precision of the numerical predictions and to assess the effect of wave reflections.},

	abstract = {According to the classical hypothesis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics, CSF is produced inside the brain ventricles, than it circulates like a slow river toward the cortical subarachnoid space, and finally it is absorbed into the venous sinuses. Some pathological conditions, primarily hydrocephalus, have also been interpreted based on this hypothesis. The development of hydrocephalus is explained as an imbalance between CSF formation and absorption, where more CSF is formed than is absorbed, which results in an abnormal increase in the CSF volume inside the cranial CSF spaces. It is believed that the reason for the imbalance is the obstruction of the CSF pathways between the site of CSF formation and the site of its absorption, which diminishes or prevents CSF outflow from the cranium. In spite of the general acceptance of the classical hypothesis, there are a considerable number of experimental results that do not support such a hypothesis and the generally accepted pathophysiology of hydrocephalus. A recently proposed new working hypothesis suggests that osmotic and hydrostatic forces at the central nervous system microvessels are crucial for the regulation of interstial fluid and CSF volume which constitute a functional unit. Based on that hypothesis, the generally accepted mechanisms of hydrocephalus development are not plausible. Therefore, the recent understanding of the correlation between CSF physiology and the development of hydrocephalus has been thoroughly presented, analyzed and evaluated, and new insights into hydrocephalus etiopathology have been proposed, which are in accordance with the experimental data and the new working hypothesis.},

This allowed investigation of a hypothesis for syrinx fluid ingress from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Gross model deformation was unchanged by the addition of porosity, but pressure oscillated more in the syrinx and the subarachnoid space below the stenosis. The poroelastic model still exhibited elevated mean pressure in the subarachnoid space below the stenosis and in the syrinx. With realistic cord permeability, there was slight oscillatory shunt flow bypassing the stenosis via the porous tissue over the syrinx. Weak steady streaming flow occurred in a circuit involving craniocaudal flow through the stenosis and back via the syrinx. Mean syrinx volume was scarcely altered when the adjacent stenosis bisected the syrinx, but increased slightly when the syrinx was predominantly located caudal to the stenosis. The fluid content of the tissues over the syrinx oscillated, absorbing most of the radial flow seeping from the subarachnoid space so that it did not reach the syrinx. To a lesser extent, this cyclic swelling in a boundary layer of cord tissue just below the pia occurred all along the cord, representing a mechanism for exchange of interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid which could explain recent tracer findings without invoking perivascular conduits. The model demonstrates that syrinx volume increase is possible when there is subarachnoid-space stenosis and the cord and pia are permeable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF circulation has been reported to represent a major factor in the pathophysiology of syringomyelia. Our purpose was to determine the CSF flow patterns in spinal cord cysts and in the subararachnoid space in patients with syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation and to evaluate the modifications of the flow resulting from surgery. METHODS: Eighteen patients with syringomyelia were examined with a 3D Fourier encoding velocity imaging technique. A prospectively gated 2D axial sequence with velocity encoding in the craniocaudal direction in the cervical region was set at a velocity of +/- 10 cm/s. Velocity measurements were performed in the larger portion of the cysts and, at the same cervical level, in the pericystic subarachnoid spaces. All patients underwent a surgical procedure involving dural opening followed by duroplasty. Pre- and postoperative velocity measurements of all patients were taken, with a mean follow-up of 10.2 months. We compared the velocity measurements with the morphology of the cysts and with the clinical data. Spinal subarachnoid spaces of 19 healthy subjects were also studied using the same technique. RESULTS: A pulsatile flow was observed in syrinx cavities and in the pericystic subarachnoid spaces (PCSS). Preoperative maximum systolic cyst velocities were higher than were diastolic velocities. A systolic velocity peak was well defined in all cases, first in the cyst and then in the PCSS. Higher systolic and diastolic cyst velocities are observed in large cysts and in patients with a poor clinical status. After surgery, a decrease in cyst volume (evaluated on the basis of the extension of the cyst and the compression of the PCSS) was observed in 13 patients. In the postoperative course, we noticed a decrease of systolic and diastolic cyst velocities and a parallel increase of systolic PCSS velocities. Diastolic cyst velocities correlated with the preoperative clinical status of the patients and, after surgery, in patients with a satisfactory foraminal enlargement evaluated on the basis of the visibility of the cisterna magna. CONCLUSION: CSF flow measurement constitutes a direct evaluation for the follow-up of patients with syringomyelic cysts. Diastolic and systolic cyst velocities can assist in the evaluation of the efficacy of surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the applicability of 4D phase contrast (4D PC) MR imaging in the assessment of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in healthy volunteers and patients with lesions at the craniocervical junction or the cervical spinal canal. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and four patients with lesions including Chiari I malformation and cervical canal stenoses were examined by a cardiac-gated 4D PC imaging sequence on 1.5T MRI. Phase contrast images were postprocessed allowing for flow quantification and flow pathline visualisation. Velocity data were compared with conventional axial 2D phase contrast images. RESULTS: The 4D PC sequence allowed for flow quantification and visualisation in all individuals. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement of 2D and 4D PC velocity data. In healthy volunteers, CSF flow was homogeneously distributed in the anterior and anterolateral subarachnoid space with the flow directed caudally during systole and cranially during diastole. Flow velocities were closely related to the width of the subarachnoid space. Patients showed grossly altered CSF flow patterns with formation of flow jets with increased flow velocities. CONCLUSIONS: 4D PC MR imaging allows for a detailed assessment of CSF flow dynamics helping to distinguish physiological from complex pathological flow patterns at the craniocervical junction and the cervical spine.},

The magnitudes of the frequency components of CSF flow in the aqueduct differ significantly between the two age groups, as do the frequency components of the cervical spinal CSF and the arterial flows. The males' aqueductal CSF stroke volumes and average flow rates are significantly higher than those of the females. Transfer functions and cross-correlations between arterial blood and CSF flow reveal significant age-dependence of phase-shift between these, as do the waveforms of arterial blood, as well as cervical-spinal and aqueductal CSF flows.

	abstract = {Fluid transport in syringomyelia has remained enigmatic ever since the disease was first identified some three centuries ago. However, accumulating evidence in the last decade from animal studies implicates arterial pulsations in syrinx formation. In particular, it has been suggested that a phase difference between the pressure pulse in the spinal subarachnoid space and the perivascular spaces, due to a pathologically disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood supply, could result in a net influx of CSF into the spinal cord (SC). A lumped-parameter model is developed of the cerebrospinal system to investigate this conjecture. It is found that although this phase-lag mechanism may operate, it requires the SC to have an intrinsic storage capacity due to the collapsibility of the contained venous reservoir. This net flux is associated with a higher mean pressure in the SC than the SSS which is maintained in the periodic steady state. According to our simulations the mechanical perturbations of arachnoiditis exacerbate the phase-lag effect, which may be partially alleviated by the presence of a posttraumatic syrinx and more completely by a syringo-subarachnoid shunt.},

	abstract = {Syrinxes are fluid-filled cavities of the spinal cord that characterize syringomyelia, a disease involving neurological damage. Their formation and expansion is poorly understood, which has hindered successful treatment. Syrinx cavities are hydraulically connected with the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS) enveloping the spinal cord via the cord interstitium and the network of perivascular spaces (PVSs), which surround blood vessels penetrating the pial membrane that is adherent to the cord surface. Since the spinal canal supports pressure wave propagation, it has been hypothesized that wave-induced fluid exchange across the pial membrane may play a role in syrinx filling. To investigate this conjecture a pair of one-dimensional (1-d) analytical models were developed from classical elastic tube theory coupled with Darcy's law for either perivascular or interstitial flow. The results show that transpial flux serves as a mechanism for damping pressure waves by alleviating hoop stress in the pial membrane. The timescale ratio over which viscous and inertial forces compete was explicitly determined, which predicts that dilated PVS, SSS flow obstructions, and a stiffer and thicker pial membrane-all associated with syringomyelia-will increase transpial flux and retard wave travel. It was also revealed that the propagation of a pressure wave is aided by a less-permeable pial membrane and, in contrast, by a more-permeable spinal cord. This is the first modeling of the spinal canal to include both pressure-wave propagation along the spinal axis and a pathway for fluid to enter and leave the cord, which provides an analytical foundation from which to approach the full poroelastic problem.},

Different differential operators arise depending on the simplifications made on the structural model. Starting from the most basic assumption of pure elastic instantaneous equilibrium, which provides a well-known algebraic relation between intramural pressure and vessel section area, we analyse in turn the effects of terms accounting for inertia, longitudinal pre-stress and viscoelasticity. The problem of how to account for branching and possible discontinuous wall properties is addressed, the latter aspect being relevant in the presence of prosthesis and stents. To this purpose a domain decomposition approach is adopted and the conditions which ensure the stability of the coupling are provided. The numerical method here used in order to carry out several test cases for the assessment of the proposed models is based on a finite element Taylor-Galerkin scheme combined with operator splitting techniques.},

An anatomically accurate 3D model of the entire SAS of a healthy volunteer was reconstructed from high resolution T2 weighted MRI data. Subject-specific pulsatile velocity boundary conditions were imposed at planes in the pontine cistern, cerebellomedullary cistern, and in the spinal subarachnoid space. Velocimetric MRI was used to measure the velocity field at these boundaries. A constant pressure boundary condition was imposed at the interface between the aqueduct of Sylvius and the fourth ventricle. The morphology of the SAS with its complex trabecula structures was taken into account through a novel porous media model with anisotropic permeability. The governing equations were solved using finite-volume CFD. We observed a total pressure variation from -42 Pa to 40 Pa within one cardiac cycle in the investigated domain. Maximum CSF velocities of about 15 cms occurred in the inferior section of the aqueduct, 14 cms in the left foramen of Luschka, and 9 cms in the foramen of Magendie. Flow velocities in the right foramen of Luschka were found to be significantly lower than in the left, indicating three-dimensional brain asymmetries. The flow in the cerebellomedullary cistern was found to be relatively diffusive with a peak Reynolds number (Re)=72, while the flow in the pontine cistern was primarily convective with a peak Re=386. The net volumetric flow rate in the spinal canal was found to be negligible despite CSF oscillation with substantial amplitude with a maximum volumetric flow rate of 109 mlmin. The observed transient flow patterns indicate a compliant behavior of the cranial subarachnoid space. Still, the estimated deformations were small owing to the large parenchymal surface. We have integrated anatomic and velocimetric MRI data with computational fluid dynamics incorporating the porous SAS morphology for the subject-specific reconstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the subarachnoid space. This model can be used as a basis for the development of computational tools, e.g., for the optimization of intrathecal drug delivery and computer-aided evaluation of cerebral pathologies such as syrinx development in syringomelia.},

CSF flow velocities and pressures in the nonresting state have not been adequately characterized. We used computer simulations to study CSF dynamics during increased heart rates in the normal and Chiari I subarachnoid space. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cyclic CSF flow was simulated for multiple cycles in idealized 3D models of the subarachnoid space for normal and Chiari I malformation subarachnoid spaces, with flow cycles corresponding to 80 or 120 heart beats per minute. Flow velocities and pressures were computed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Synchronous bidirectional flow and flow patterns were displayed in Star-CD and inspected visually. Peak velocities and pressure differences in the 2 models were compared for the 2-cycle frequencies. RESULTS: Elevating the cycle rate from 80 to 120 cpm increased peak superior-inferior pressure gradients (top-bottom) by just 0.01\% in the normal model and 2\% in the Chiari model. Corresponding average pressure gradients increased by 92\% and 100\%, respectively. In addition, in both models, the range of synchronous bidirectional flow velocities increased. Systolic velocities had smaller increases with faster cycling. For each cycle rate, peak and average pressure gradients in the Chiari model were greater than in the normal model by 11\%-16\%. CONCLUSIONS: Raising the cycle rate from 80 to 120 cpm increased superior-inferior average pressure gradients and the range of synchronous bidirectional flow velocities in the normal and Chiari I models.},

The pulsating CSF flow was modeled using a time-varying velocity pulse based on peak velocity measurements (diastole and systole) derived from a selection of patients with Chiari I malformation. The present study introduces the general definition of the Reynolds number to provide a measure of CSF flow instability to give an estimate of the possibility of turbulence occurring in CSF flow. This was motivated by the fact that the combination of pulsating flow and the geometric complexity of the spinal canal may result in local Reynolds numbers that are significantly higher than the commonly used global measure such that flow instabilities may develop into turbulent flow in these regions. The local Reynolds number was used in combination with derived statistics to characterize the flow. The results revealed the existence of both local unstable regions and local regions with velocity fluctuations similar in magnitude to what is observed in fully turbulent flows. The results also indicated that the fluctuations were not self-sustained turbulence, but rather flow instabilities that may develop into turbulence. The case considered was therefore believed to represent a CSF flow close to transition.},

	abstract = {Pulse wave evaluation is an effective method for arteriosclerosis screening. In a previous study, we verified that pulse waveforms change markedly due to arterial stiffness. However, a pulse wave consists of two components, the incident wave and multireflected waves. Clarification of the complicated propagation of these waves is necessary to gain an understanding of the nature of pulse waves in vivo. In this study, we built a one-dimensional theoretical model of a pressure wave propagating in a flexible tube. To evaluate the applicability of the model, we compared theoretical estimations with measured data obtained from basic tube models and a simple arterial model. We constructed different viscoelastic tube set-ups: two straight tubes; one tube connected to two tubes of different elasticity; a single bifurcation tube; and a simple arterial network with four bifurcations. Soft polyurethane tubes were used and the configuration was based on a realistic human arterial network. The tensile modulus of the material was similar to the elasticity of arteries. A pulsatile flow with ejection time 0.3 s was applied using a controlled pump. Inner pressure waves and flow velocity were then measured using a pressure sensor and an ultrasonic diagnostic system. We formulated a 1D model derived from the Navier-Stokes equations and a continuity equation to characterize pressure propagation in flexible tubes. The theoretical model includes nonlinearity and attenuation terms due to the tube wall, and flow viscosity derived from a steady Hagen-Poiseuille profile. Under the same configuration as for experiments, the governing equations were computed using the MacCormack scheme. The theoretical pressure waves for each case showed a good fit to the experimental waves. The square sum of residuals (difference between theoretical and experimental wave-forms) for each case was {\textbackslash}textless10.0\%. A possible explanation for the increase in the square sum of residuals is the approximation error for flow viscosity. However, the comparatively small values prove the validity of the approach and indicate the usefulness of the model for understanding pressure propagation in the human arterial network.},

The solution of the conservation of CSF mass and momentum balances over a finite computational mesh obtained from the MR images predict the patients' CSF flow and pressure field. Advanced image reconstruction tools used in conjunction with first principles of fluid mechanics allow an accurate verification of the CSF flow patters for individual patients. This paper presents a detailed analysis of pulsatile CSF flow and pressure dynamics in a normal and hydrocephalic patient. Experimental CSF flow measurements and computational results of flow and pressure fields in the ventricular system, the SAS and brain parenchyma are presented. The pulsating CSF motion is explored in normal and pathological conditions of communicating hydrocephalus. This paper predicts small transmantle pressure differences between lateral ventricles and SASs (approximately 10 Pa). The transmantle pressure between ventricles and SAS remains small even in the hydrocephalic patient (approximately 30 Pa), but the ICP pulsatility increases by a factor of four. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results of the predicted CSF flow velocities are in good agreement with Cine MRI measurements. Differences between the predicted and observed CSF flow velocities in the prepontine area point towards complex brain-CSF interactions.

METHODS: A PubMed search of literature pertaining to cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics was performed with a particular focus on those that utilized methods such as computational fluid dynamics or experimental flow modeling. DISCUSSION: From the engineer's perspective, type I Chiari malformation is an abnormal geometry of the cerebellum that causes increased resistance to cerebrospinal fluid flow between the intracranial and spinal subarachnoid space. As such, understanding the hydrodynamics of cerebrospinal fluid in the craniospinal subarachnoid space has long been thought to be important in the diagnosis and management of type I Chiari malformation. Hydrodynamic quantification of cerebrospinal fluid motion in the subarachnoid space may better reflect the pathophysiology of the disorder and serve as a prognostic indicator in conjunction with geometric magnetic resonance measurements that are currently used clinically. This review discusses the results of studies that have sought to quantify the hydrodynamics of cerebrospinal fluid motion using computational and experimental modeling and critiques the methods by which the results were obtained. CONCLUSION: Researchers have found differences in cerebrospinal fluid velocities and pressures in type I Chiari malformation patients compared to healthy subjects. However, further research is necessary to determine the causal relationship between changes to hydrodynamic parameters such as cerebrospinal fluid velocity, pressure, resistance to flow, and craniospinal compliance and clinical aspects such as neurological symptoms, radiological evidence of severity, and surgical success.},

The arterial tree is truncated after the first few generations of large arteries with the remaining small arteries and arterioles providing outflow boundary conditions for the large arteries. By modeling the small arteries and arterioles as a structured tree, a semi-analytical approach based on a linearized version of the governing equations can be used to derive an expression for the root impedance of the structured tree in the frequency domain. In the time domain, this provides the proper outflow boundary condition. The structured tree is a binary asymmetric tree in which the radii of the daughter vessels are scaled linearly with the radius of the parent vessel. Blood flow and pressure in the large vessels are computed as functions of time and axial distance within each of the arteries. Comparison between the simulations and magnetic resonance measurements in the ascending aorta and nine peripheral locations in one individual shows excellent agreement between the two. © 2000 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

	abstract = {In this paper a one-dimensional model of a vascular network based on space-time variables is investigated. Although the one-dimensional system has been more widely studied using a space-frequency decomposition, the space-time formulation offers a more direct physical interpretation of the dynamics of the system. The objective of the paper is to highlight how the space-time representation of the linear and nonlinear one-dimensional system can be theoretically and numerically modelled. In deriving the governing equations from first principles, the assumptions involved in constructing the system in terms of area-mass flux (A,Q), area-velocity (A,u), pressure-velocity (p,u) and pressure-mass flux(p,Q) variables are discussed. For the nonlinear hyperbolic system expressed in terms of the (A,u) variables the extension of the single-vessel model to a network of vessels is achieved using a characteristic decomposition combined with conservation of mass and total pressure. The more widely studied linearised system is also discussed where conservation of static pressure, instead of total pressure, is enforced in the extension to a network. Consideration of the linearised system also allows for the derivation of a reflection coefficient analogous to the approach adopted in acoustics and surface waves. The derivation of the fundamental equations in conservative and characteristic variables provides the basic information for many numerical approaches. In the current work the linear and nonlinear systems have been solved using a spectral/hp element spatial discretisation with a discontinuous Galerkin formulation and a second-order Adams-Bashforth time-integration scheme. The numerical scheme is then applied to a model arterial network of the human vascular system previously studied by Wang and Parker (To appear in J. Biomech. (2004)). Using this numerical model the role of nonlinearity is also considered by comparison of the linearised and nonlinearised results. Similar to previous work only secondary contributions are observed from the nonlinear effects under physiological conditions in the systemic system. Finally, the effect of the reflection coefficient on reversal of the flow waveform in the parent vessel of a bifurcation is considered for a system with a low terminal resistance as observed in vessels such as the umbilical arteries.},

	abstract = {According to some theories, obstruction of CSF flow produces a pressure drop in the subarachnoid space in accordance with the Bernoulli theorem that explains the development of syringomyelia below the obstruction. However, Bernoulli's principle applies to inviscid stationary flow unlike CSF flow. Therefore, we performed a series of computational experiments to investigate the relationship between pressure drop, flow velocities, and obstructions under physiologic conditions. We created geometric models with dimensions approximating the spinal subarachnoid space with varying degrees of obstruction. Pressures and velocities for constant and oscillatory flow of a viscid fluid were calculated with the Navier-Stokes equations. Pressure and velocity along the length of the models were also calculated by the Bernoulli equation and compared with the results from the Navier-Stokes equations. In the models, fluid velocities and pressure gradients were approximately inversely proportional to the percentage of the channel that remained open. Pressure gradients increased minimally with 35\% obstruction and with factors 1.4, 2.2 and 5.0 respectively with 60, 75 and 85\% obstruction. Bernoulli's law underestimated pressure changes by at least a factor 2 and predicted a pressure increase downstream of the obstruction, which does not occur. For oscillatory flow the phase difference between pressure maxima and velocity maxima changed with the degree of obstruction. Inertia and viscosity which are not factored into the Bernoulli equation affect CSF flow. Obstruction of CSF flow in the cervical spinal canal increases pressure gradients and velocities and decreases the phase lag between pressure and velocity.},

The exact mechanism causing syringomyelia remains unknown. Since syringomyelia occurs frequently in association with obstructed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, it has been hypothesized that syrinx formation is mechanically driven. In this study we model the spinal cord tissue either as a poro-elastic medium or as a solid linear elastic medium, and simulate the propagation of pressure waves through an anatomically plausible 3D geometry, with boundary conditions based on in vivo CSF pressure measurements. Then various anatomic and tissue properties are modified, resulting in a total of 11 variations of the model that are compared. The results show that an open segment of the central canal and a stiff pia (relative to the cord) both increase the radial pressure gradients and enhance interstitial fluid flow in the central canal. The anterior median fissure, anisotropic permeability of the white matter, and Poisson ratio play minor roles.},

In this study we obtained time-resolved three directional velocity encoded phase-contrast MRI (4D PC MRI) in three healthy volunteers and four CM patients and compared the 4D PC MRI measurements to subject-specific 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The CFD simulations considered the geometry to be rigid-walled and did not include small anatomical structures such as nerve roots, denticulate ligaments and arachnoid trabeculae. Results were compared at nine axial planes along the cervical SSS in terms of peak CSF velocities in both the cranial and caudal direction and visual interpretation of thru-plane velocity profiles. 4D PC MRI peak CSF velocities were consistently greater than the CFD peak velocities and these differences were more pronounced in CM patients than in healthy subjects. In the upper cervical SSS of CM patients the 4D PC MRI quantified stronger fluid jets than the CFD. Visual interpretation of the 4D PC MRI thru-plane velocity profiles showed greater pulsatile movement of CSF in the anterior SSS in comparison to the posterior and reduction in local CSF velocities near nerve roots. CFD velocity profiles were relatively uniform around the spinal cord for all subjects. This study represents the first comparison of 4D PC MRI measurements to CFD of CSF flow in the cervical SSS. The results highlight the utility of 4D PC MRI for evaluation of complex CSF dynamics and the need for improvement of CFD methodology. Future studies are needed to investigate whether integration of fine anatomical structures and gross motion of the brain and/or spinal cord into the computational model will lead to a better agreement between the two techniques.},

Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 29 +/- 7) were studied in supine and upright (sitting) postures. A Cine phase-contrast MRI technique was used to image the pulsatile blood flow to the brain, the venous outflow through the internal jugular, epidural, and vertebral veins, and the bi-directional CSF flow between the cranium and the spinal canal. Previously published analyses were applied to calculate and compare total cerebral blood flow (TCBF), intracranial compliance and pressure in both postures. A lower (12\%) mean TCBF was measured in the upright position compared to supine position. A considerable smaller amount of CSF flow between the cranium and the spinal canal (58\%), a much larger intracranial compliance (a 2.8-fold increase), and a corresponding decrease in the MRI-derived ICP were also measured in the sitting position. These changes suggest that the increased cerebrovascular and intracranial compliances in the upright posture are primarily due to reduced amounts of blood and CSF residing in their respective intracranial compartments in the upright position. This work demonstrates the ability to quantify neurophysiologic parameters associated with regulation of cerebral hemodynamics and hydrodynamics from dynamic MR imaging of blood and CSF flows.},

METHODS: Cine phase-contrast MR was obtained in 17 volunteers. The temporal velocity information from the cervical pericord CSF spaces, basal cisterns, and aqueduct, as well as the internal carotid and vertebral arteries and internal jugular veins, were plotted as waveforms. The waveforms were analyzed for configurations, amplitudes, and temporal patterns. In four volunteers the reproducibility of the precord CSF flow waveforms was examined on different days. In three volunteers the effect of jugular venous compression on the precord and aqueductal CSF flow waveforms was also evaluated. RESULTS: (a) Distinct and reproducible configurational features were observed in the CSF flow waveforms. Jugular venous compression produced elevation of the disatolic slope of the precord waveforms. (b) The amplitudes were variable. Jugular venous compression reduced the precord CSF velocities. (c) The systolic temporal parameters were less variable and more reproducible than the diastolic temporal parameters. Jugular venous compression resulted in delay in the systolic parameters of the precord waveforms. (d) Craniocaudal and caudocranial postcord CSF flow occurred either simultaneous with or earlier than the precord CSF flow. Pericord CSF flow in either direction preceded that in the cisterns and in the aqueduct. (e) A significant temporal relationship was noted in the precord space between the time of the R wave to the maximum velocities and the arterial flow.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of MR imaging to assess the CSF flow response to a Valsalva maneuver in healthy participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cardiac-gated fast cine-PC sequence with ≤15-second acquisition time was used to assess CSF flow in 8 healthy participants at the foramen magnum at rest, during, and immediately after a controlled Valsalva maneuver. CSF mean displacement volume V̄CSF during the cardiac cycle and CSF flow waveform App were determined. A work-in-progress real-time pencil-beam imaging method with temporal resolution ≤56 ms was used to scan 2 participants for 90 seconds during which resting, Valsalva, and post-Valsalva CSF flow, respiration, and HR were continuously recorded. Results were qualitatively compared with invasive craniospinal differential pressure measurements from the literature. RESULTS: Both methods showed 1) a decrease from baseline in V̄CSF and App during Valsalva and 2) an increase in V̄CSF and App immediately after Valsalva compared with values measured both at rest and during Valsalva. Whereas fast cine-PC produced a single CSF flow waveform that is an average over many cardiac cycles, pencil-beam imaging depicted waveforms for each heartbeat and was able to capture many dynamic features of CSF flow, including transients synchronized with the Valsalva maneuver. CONCLUSIONS: Both fast cine-PC and pencil-beam imaging demonstrated expected changes in CSF flow with Valsalva maneuver in healthy participants. The real-time capability of pencil-beam imaging may be necessary to detect Valsalva-related transient CSF flow obstruction in patients with pathologic conditions such as Chiari I malformation.},

Systolic pulsations were modelled as travelling waves on the arterial wall. The effects of wave geometry and variable pressure conditions on fluid flow were investigated. Arterial pulsations induce fluid movement in the PVS in the direction of arterial wave travel. Perivascular flow continues even in the presence of adverse pressure gradients of a few kilopascals. Flow rates are greater with increasing pulse wave velocities and arterial deformation, as both an absolute amplitude and as a proportion of the PVS. The model suggests that arterial pulsations are sufficient to cause fluid flow in the perivascular space even against modest adverse pressure gradients. Local increases in flow in this perivascular pumping mechanism or reduction in outflow may be important in the etiology of syringomyelia.},

	abstract = {OBJECT: The mechanisms of syringomyelia have long puzzled neurosurgeons and researchers alike due to difficulties in identifying the driving forces behind fluid flow into a syrinx, apparently against a pressure gradient between the spinal cord and the subarachnoid space (SAS). Recently, the synchronization between CSF flow and the cardiac cycle has been postulated to affect fluid flow in the spinal cord. This study aims to determine the effect of changes in the timing of SAS pressure on perivascular flow into the spinal cord. METHODS: This study uses a computational fluid dynamics model to investigate whether the relative timing of a spinal artery cardiovascular pulse wave and fluid pressure in the spinal SAS can influence CSF flow in the perivascular spaces. RESULTS: The results show that the mass flow rate of CSF through a model periarterial space is strongly influenced by the relative timing of the arterial pulse wave and the SAS pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that factors that might alter the timing of the pulse wave or the fluid flow in the SAS could potentially affect fluid flow into a syrinx.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence has cast doubt on the classical model of river-like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow from the choroid plexus to the arachnoid granulations. We propose a novel model of water transport through the parenchyma from the microcirculation as driven by Starling forces. This model investigates the effect of osmotic pressure on water transport between the cerebral vasculature, the extracellular space (ECS), the perivascular space (PVS), and the CSF. A rigorous literature search was conducted focusing on experiments which alter the osmolarity of blood or ventricles and measure the rate of CSF production. Investigations into the effect of osmotic pressure on the volume of ventricles and the flux of ions in the blood, choroid plexus epithelium, and CSF are reviewed. Increasing the osmolarity of the serum via a bolus injection completely inhibits nascent fluid flow production in the ventricles. A continuous injection of a hyperosmolar solution into the ventricles can increase the volume of the ventricle by up to 125\%. CSF production is altered by 0.231 μL per mOsm in the ventricle and by 0.835 μL per mOsm in the serum. Water flux from the ECS to the CSF is identified as a key feature of intracranial dynamics. A complete mathematical model with all equations and scenarios is fully described, as well as a guide to constructing a computational model of intracranial water balance dynamics. The model proposed in this article predicts the effects the osmolarity of ECS, blood, and CSF on water flux in the brain, establishing a link between osmotic imbalances and pathological conditions such as hydrocephalus and edema.},

	abstract = {According to the traditional hypothesis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is secreted inside the brain ventricles and flows unidirectionally along subarachnoid spaces to be absorbed into venous sinuses across arachnoid villi and/or via paraneural sheaths of nerves into lymphatics. However, according to recent investigations, it appears that interstitial fluid (ISF) and CSF are formed by water filtration across the walls of arterial capillaries in the central nervous system (CNS), while plasma osmolytes are sieved (retained) so that capillary osmotic counterpressure is generated, which is instrumental in ISF/CSF water absorption into venous capillaries and postcapillary venules. This hypothesis is supported by experiments showing that water, which constitutes 99\% of CSF and ISF bulk, does not flow along CSF spaces since it is rapidly absorbed into adjacent CNS microvessels, while distribution of other substances along CSF spaces depends on the rate of their removal into microvessels: faster removal means more limited distribution. Furthermore, the acute occlusion of aqueduct of Sylvius does not change CSF pressure in isolated ventricles, suggesting that the formation and the absorption of CSF are in balance. Multidirectional distribution of substances inside CSF, as well as between CSF and ISF, is caused by to-and-fro pulsations of these fluids and their mixing. Absorption of CSF into venous sinuses and/or lymphatics under the physiological pressure should be of minor importance due to their minute surface area in comparison to the huge absorptive surface area of microvessels.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics in patients with Chiari type I malformation (CM) with and without syringomyelia using 4D magnetic resonance (MR) phase contrast (PC) flow imaging. METHODS: 4D-PC CSF flow data were acquired in 20 patients with CM (12 patients with presyrinx/syrinx). Characteristic 4D-CSF flow patterns were identified. Quantitative CSF flow parameters were assessed at the craniocervical junction and the cervical spinal canal and compared with healthy volunteers and between patients with and without syringomyelia. RESULTS: Compared with healthy volunteers, 17 CM patients showed flow abnormalities at the craniocervical junction in the form of heterogeneous flow (n = 3), anterolateral flow jets (n = 14) and flow vortex formation (n = 5), most prevalent in patients with syringomyelia. Peak flow velocities at the craniocervical junction were significantly increased in patients (-15.5 ± 11.3 vs. -4.7 ± 0.7 cm/s in healthy volunteers, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). At the level of C1, maximum systolic flow was found to be significantly later in the cardiac cycle in patients (30.8 ± 10.3 vs. 22.7 ± 4.1\%, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05).

As syringomyelia is associated with abnormalities of the central nervous system that obstruct cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, it is thought that changes in CSF dynamics play an important role in its pathogenesis. Using three-dimensional computational models of the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS), this study aims to determine SAS obstructions, such as arachnoiditis, change in CSF dynamics in the SAS. The geometry of the SAS was reconstructed from a series of MRI images. CSF is modelled as an incompressible Newtonian fluid with a dynamic viscosity of 1 mPa s. Three computational models simulated CSF flow in either the unobstructed SAS, or with the SAS obstructed by a porous region simulating dorsal or circumferential arachnoiditis. The permeability of this porous obstruction was varied for the model with dorsal arachnoiditis. The results show that arachnoiditis increases flow resistance in the SAS and this is accompanied by a modest increase in magnitude and/or shift in timing (with respect to the cardiac cycle) of the CSF pressure drop across the region of arachnoiditis. This study suggests that syrinx formation may be related to a change in temporal CSF pulse pressure dynamics.},

METHODS: Control volume analysis is presented to introduce the reader to the theoretical background of this foundational fluid mechanics technique for application to general control volumes. This approach is able to directly incorporate the diverse measurements obtained by clinicians to better elucidate intracranial dynamics and progression to disorder. RESULTS: Several examples of meaningful intracranial control volumes and the particular measurement sets needed for the analysis are discussed. CONCLUSION: Control volume analysis provides a framework to guide the type and location of measurements and also a way to interpret the resulting data within a fundamental fluid physics analysis.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms behind CSF flow in humans are still not fully known. CSF circulates from its primary production sites at the choroid plexus through the brain ventricles to reach the outer surface of the brain in the subarachnoid spaces from where it drains into venous bloodstream and cervical lymphatics. According to a recent concept of brain fluid transport, established in rodents, CSF from the brain surface also enters the brain tissue along para-arterial routes and exits through paravenous spaces again into subarachnoid compartments. This unidirectional flow is mainly driven by arterial pulsation. To investigate how CSF flow is regulated in humans, we applied a novel real-time magnetic resonance imaging technique at high spatial (0.75 mm) and temporal (50 ms) resolution in healthy human subjects. We observed significant CSF flow exclusively with inspiration. In particular, during forced breathing, high CSF flow was elicited during every inspiration, whereas breath holding suppressed it. Only a minor flow component could be ascribed to cardiac pulsation. The present results unambiguously identify inspiration as the most important driving force for CSF flow in humans. Inspiratory thoracic pressure reduction is expected to directly modulate the hydrostatic pressure conditions for the low-resistance paravenous, venous, and lymphatic clearance routes of CSF. Furthermore, the experimental approach opens new clinical opportunities to study the pathophysiology of various forms of hydrocephalus and to design therapeutic strategies in relation to CSF flow alterations.},

Infusion tests with a radionucleotide and fluorescent dye under stagnant and pulsatile flow conditions were conducted inside an experimental surrogate model of the human spinal canal.

The experimental results show that CSF flow oscillations substantially enhance fluorescent dye and radionucleotide dispersion in the spinal canal experiment.

ISF flow, estimated from rates of removal of markers from the brain, has been thought to reflect rates of fluid secretion across the blood-brain barrier, although this has been questioned because measurements were made under barbiturate anaesthesia possibly affecting secretion and flow and because CSF influx to the parenchyma via perivascular routes may deliver fluid independently of blood-brain barrier secretion. Fluid secretion at the blood-brain barrier is provided by specific transporters that generate solute fluxes so creating osmotic gradients that force water to follow. Any flow due to hydrostatic pressures driving water across the barrier soon ceases unless accompanied by solute transport because water movements modify solute concentrations. CSF is thought to be derived primarily from secretion by the choroid plexuses. Flow rates measured using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging reveal CSF movements to be more rapid and variable than previously supposed, even implying that under some circumstances net flow through the cerebral aqueduct may be reversed with net flow into the third and lateral ventricles. Such reversed flow requires there to be alternative sites for both generation and removal of CSF. Fluorescent tracer analysis has shown that fluid flow can occur from CSF into parenchyma along periarterial spaces. Whether this represents net fluid flow and whether there is subsequent flow through the interstitium and net flow out of the cortex via perivenous routes, described as glymphatic circulation, remains to be established. Modern techniques have revealed complex fluid movements within the brain. This review provides a critical evaluation of the data.},

	abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a Newtonian fluid and can, therefore, be modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Previous modelling of the CSF has been limited to simplified geometric models. This work describes a geometrically accurate three dimensional (3D) computational model of the human ventricular system (HVS) constructed from magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human brain. It is an accurate and full representation of the HVS and includes appropriately positioned CSF production and drainage locations. It was used to investigate the pulsatile motion of CSF within the human brain. During this investigation CSF flow rate was set at a constant 500 ml/day, to mimic real life secretion of CSF into the system, and a pulsing velocity profile was added to the inlets to incorporate the effect of cardiac pulsations on the choroid plexus and their subsequent influence on CSF motion in the HVS. Boundary conditions for the CSF exits from the ventricles (foramina of Magendie and Lushka) were found using a "nesting" approach, in which a simplified model of the entire central nervous system (CNS) was used to examine the effects of the CSF surrounding the ventricular system (VS). This model provided time varying pressure data for the exits from the VS nested within it. The fastest flow was found in the cerebral aqueduct, where a maximum velocity of 11.38 mm/s was observed over five cycles. The maximum Reynolds number recorded during the simulation was 15 with an average Reynolds number of the order of 0.39, indicating that CSF motion is creeping flow in most of the computational domain and consequently will follow the geometry of the model. CSF pressure also varies with geometry with a maximum pressure drop of 1.14 Pa occurring through the cerebral aqueduct. CSF flow velocity is substantially slower in the areas that are furthest away from the inlets; in some areas flow is nearly stagnant.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug delivery is an efficient method to administer therapeutic molecules to the central nervous system. However, even with identical drug dosage and administration mode, the extent of drug distribution in vivo is highly variable and difficult to control. Different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsatility from patient to patient may lead to different drug distribution. Medical image-based computational fluid dynamics (miCFD) is used to construct a patient-specific model to quantify drug transport as a function of a spectrum of physiological CSF pulsations. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CINE MRI were performed to capture the patient's central nervous system anatomy and CSF pulsatile flow velocities. An miCFD model was reconstructed from these MRIs and the patient's CSF flow velocities were computed. The effect of CSF pulsatility (frequency and stroke volume) was investigated for a bolus injection of a model drug at the L2 vertebral level. Drug distribution profiles along the entire spine were computed for different heart rates: 43, 60, and 120 bpm, and varied CSF stroke volumes: 1, 2, and 3 mL. To assess toxicity risk for patients with different physiological variables, therapeutic and toxic concentration thresholds for a common anesthetic were derived from experimental studies. Toxicity risk analysis was performed for an injection of a spinal anesthetic for patients with different heart rates and CSF stroke volumes. RESULTS: Both heart rate and CSF stroke volume of the patient strongly influence drug distribution administered intrathecally. Doubling the heart rate (from 60 to 120 bpm) caused a 26.4\% decrease in peak concentration in CSF after injection. Doubling the CSF stroke volume diminished the peak concentration after injection by 38.1\%. Computations show that potentially toxic peak concentrations due to injection can be avoided by changing the infusion rate. Using slower infusion rates could avoid high peak concentrations in CSF while maintaining drug concentrations above the therapeutic threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our computations identify key variables for patient to patient variability in drug distribution in the spine observed clinically. The speed of drug transport is strongly affected by the frequency and magnitude of CSF pulsations. Toxicity risks associated with an injection can be reduced for a particular patient by adjusting the infusion variables with our rigorous miCFD model.},

Prior reports have suggested that paravascular bulk flow of CSF or ISF may be driven by arterial pulsation. However, cerebral arterial pulsation could not be directly assessed. In the present study, we use in vivo two-photon microscopy in mice to visualize vascular wall pulsatility in penetrating intracortical arteries. We observed that unilateral ligation of the internal carotid artery significantly reduced arterial pulsatility by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde50\%, while systemic administration of the adrenergic agonist dobutamine increased pulsatility of penetrating arteries by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde60\%. When paravascular CSF-ISF exchange was evaluated in real time using in vivo two-photon and ex vivo fluorescence imaging, we observed that internal carotid artery ligation slowed the rate of paravascular CSF-ISF exchange, while dobutamine increased the rate of paravascular CSF-ISF exchange. These findings demonstrate that cerebral arterial pulsatility is a key driver of paravascular CSF influx into and through the brain parenchyma, and suggest that changes in arterial pulsatility may contribute to accumulation and deposition of toxic solutes, including amyloid β, in the aging brain.},

Consequently, it has been assumed that arachnoid projections into the cranial venous system are responsible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption. However, recent quantitative and qualitative evidence in sheep suggest that nasal lymphatics have the major role in CSF transport. Nonetheless, the applicability of this concept to other species, especially to humans has never been clarified. The purpose of this study was to compare the CSF and nasal lymph associations in human and non-human primates with those observed in other mammalian species. Methods Studies were performed in sheep, pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, monkeys and humans. Immediately after sacrifice (or up to 7 hours after death in humans), yellow Microfil was injected into the CSF compartment. The heads were cut in a sagittal plane. Results In the seven species examined, Microfil was observed primarily in the subarachnoid space around the olfactory bulbs and cribriform plate. The contrast agent followed the olfactory nerves and entered extensive lymphatic networks in the submucosa associated with the olfactory and respiratory epithelium. This is the first direct evidence of the association between the CSF and nasal lymph compartments in humans. Conclusions The fact that the pattern of Microfil distribution was similar in all species tested, suggested that CSF absorption into nasal lymphatics is a characteristic feature of all mammals including humans. It is tempting to speculate that some disorders of the CSF system (hydrocephalus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension for example) may relate either directly or indirectly to a lymphatic CSF absorption deficit.},

This phenomenon has been recently validated in vivo on MR images by applying spectral analysis to signal–time curves at selected regions of interest. However, selecting regions of interest requires knowledge of physiology and anatomy, and manual selection is time consuming. We postulate that CSF pulsation is passively modulated by intra-thoracic pressure that is secondary to respiration, and this pulsation can be observed as a flow-related enhancement on MR images. To investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of respiratory rhythms in human brains, we conducted a study on MR scanning of 12 healthy volunteers who performed normal-breathing and breath-holding experiments during scanning. Spectral analysis, spectroscopic images, independent component analysis and signal measurements in selected regions were applied to dynamic MR images acquired from these volunteers. Through independent component analysis, respiratory rhythms were found at the vicinity of ventricles and CSF areas in nine subjects in normal-breathing experiments. In breath-holding experiments, respiratory rhythm suppression and vessel dilation were observed in 8 and 10 subjects, respectively. Information obtained from this study further elucidates the respiratory modulation of CSF in vivo.},

The purpose of this review is to understand evidences based on the known theories and to create a new hypothesis of the pathogenesis. We critically review the literatures on clinicopathological, radiological, and clinical features of this disorder. The previously proposed theories mainly focused on the driven mechanisms of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the spinal cord. They did not fully explain radiological features or effects of surgical treatment such as shunting procedures. Common findings of the syrinx in clinicopathological studies were the communication with the central canal and extracanalicular extension to the posterior gray matter. Most of the magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated blockade and alternated CSF dynamics at the foramen magnum, but failed to show direct communication of the syrinx with the CSF spaces. Pressure studies revealed almost identical intrasyrinx pressure to the subarachnoid space and decreased compliance of the spinal CSF space. Recent imaging studies suggest that the extracellular fluid accumulation may play an important role. The review of evidences promotes a new hypothesis of syrinx formation. Decreased absorption mechanisms of the extracellular fluid may underlie the pathogenesis of syringomyelia. Reduced compliance of the posterior spinal veins associated with the decreased compliance of the spinal subarachnoid space will result in disturbed absorption of the extracellular fluid through the intramedullary venous channels and formation of syringomyelia.},

Following injection of the ink, deep cervical lymph nodes were selectively blackened within 30 min and lumbar para-aortic nodes within 6 h. Within the cranial cavity, carbon particles accumulated in the basal cisterns but were also distributed in the paravascular spaces around the middle cerebral arteries and the nasal-olfactory artery. Carbon particles in the subarachnoid space beneath the olfactory bulbs drained directly into discrete channels which passed through the cribriform plate and into lymphatics in the nasal submucosa. Although ink was distributed along the subarachnoid space of the optic nerves and entered the cochlea, the nasal route was the only direct connection between cranial CSF and lymphatics. Arachnoid villi associated with superior and inferior sagittal sinuses were identified and a minor amount of drainage of ink into dural lymphatics was also observed. This study demonstrates the direct drainage of cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate in anatomically defined channels which connect with the nasal lymphatics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The pressure propagation between the third and lateral ventricles was examined and compared to data obtained from a similar geometry with a stenosed aqueduct. It could be shown that the pressure amplitude in the lateral ventricles increases in the presence of aqueduct stenosis. No difference in phase shift between the motion of the third ventricle walls and the pressure in the lateral ventricles because of the aqueduct stenosis could be observed. It is deduced that CFD can be used to analyze the pressure propagation and its phase shift relative to the ventricle wall motion. It is further deduced that only models that take into account the coupling between ventricles, which feature a representation of the original geometry that is as accurate as possible and which represent the ventricle boundary motion realistically, should be used to make quantitative statements on flow and pressure in the ventricular space.},

The goal of this study was to develop an idealized 3D computational model of the subarachnoid space and then to use this model to study the detailed spatiotemporal effects of anatomic variations on CSF pressures and velocities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a geometric model with a computer-assisted design program. The model contained a central structure for the brain and spinal cord axis and a second surrounding structure for the peripheral borders of the subarachnoid space. Model dimensions were adjusted to capture the main characteristics of the normal human posterior fossa and cervical spinal anatomy. CSF flow was modeled as water with a sinusoidal flow pattern in time. Velocities and pressures during craniocaudal and caudocranial flow were calculated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Simulated flow was compared with published phase-contrast MR imaging measurements of CSF flow in healthy human subjects. RESULTS: The model contained geometric characteristics of the posterior fossa and spinal canal. Flow velocities varied with the time in the cycle and location in space. Flow velocities had spatial variations that resembled those in healthy human subjects. Reynolds numbers were moderate, showing a laminar flow regime. Pressure varied uniformly along the long axis of the model during craniocaudal and caudocranial flow. CONCLUSIONS: In an idealized geometric approximation of the human subarachnoid space, CSF velocities and pressures can be studied in spatiotemporal detail with mathematic models.},

This model of fluid-structure interactions predicts flows and pressures throughout the brain's ventricular pathways consistent with both animal intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements and human CINE phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging data. The computations provide approximations of the tissue deformations of the brain parenchyma.

	abstract = {CINE phase-contrast MRI (CINE-MRI) was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocities and flow rates in the brain of six normal subjects and five patients with communicating hydrocephalus. Mathematical brain models were created using the MRI images of normal subjects and hydrocephalic patients. In our model, the effect of pulsatile vascular expansion is responsible for pulsatile CSF flow between the cranial and the spinal subarachnoidal spaces. Simulation results include intracranial pressure gradients, solid stresses and strains, and fluid velocities throughout the cranio-spinal system. Computed velocities agree closely with our in vivo CINE-MRI CSF flow measurements. In addition to normal intracranial dynamics, our model captures the transition to acute communicating hydrocephalus. By increasing the value for reabsorption resistance in the subarachnoid villi, our model predicts that the poroelastic parenchyma matrix will be drained and the ventricles enlarge despite small transmantle pressure gradients during the transitional phase. The poroelastic simulation thus provides a plausible explanation on how reabsorption changes could be responsible for enlargement of the ventricles without large transmantle pressure gradients.},

	abstract = {A simplified in vitro model of the spinal canal, based on in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, was used to examine the hydrodynamics of the human spinal cord and subarachnoid space with syringomyelia. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of subarachnoid (SAS) geometry and cerebrospinal fluid velocity were acquired in a patient with syringomyelia and used to aid in the in vitro model design and experiment. The in vitro model contained a fluid-filled coaxial elastic tube to represent a syrinx. A computer controlled pulsatile pump was used to subject the in vitro model to a CSF flow waveform representative of that measured in vivo. Fluid velocity was measured at three axial locations within the in vitro model using the same MRI scanner as the patient study. Pressure and syrinx wall motion measurements were conducted external to the MR scanner using the same model and flow input. Transducers measured unsteady pressure both in the SAS and intra-syrinx at four axial locations in the model. A laser Doppler vibrometer recorded the syrinx wall motion at 18 axial locations and three polar positions. Results indicated that the peak-to-peak amplitude of the SAS flow waveform in vivo was approximately tenfold that of the syrinx and in phase (SAS∼5.2±0.6ml∕s,syrinx∼0.5±0.3ml∕s). The in vitro flow waveform approximated the in vivo peak-to-peak magnitude (SAS∼4.6±0.2ml∕s,syrinx∼0.4±0.3ml∕s). Peak-to-peak in vitro pressure variation in both the SAS and syrinx was approximately 6 mm Hg. Syrinx pressure waveform lead the SAS pressure waveform by approximately 40 ms. Syrinx pressure was found to be less than the SAS for ∼200ms during the 860-ms flow cycle. Unsteady pulse wave velocity in the syrinx was computed to be a maximum of ∼25m∕s. LDV measurements indicated that spinal cord wall motion was nonaxisymmetric with a maximum displacement of ∼140μm, which is below the resolution limit of MRI. Agreement between in vivo and in vitro MR measurements demonstrates that the hydrodynamics in the fluid filled coaxial elastic tube system are similar to those present in a single patient with syringomyelia. The presented in vitro study of spinal cord wall motion, and complex unsteady pressure and flow environment within the syrinx and SAS, provides insight into the complex biomechanical forces present in syringomyelia.},

	abstract = {Full explanation for the pathogenesis of syringomyelia (SM), a neuropathology characterized by the formation of a cystic cavity (syrinx) in the spinal cord (SC), has not yet been provided. It has been hypothesized that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, caused by subarachnoid space (SAS) flow blockage (stenosis), is an underlying cause of syrinx formation and subsequent pain in the patient. However, paucity in detailed in vivo pressure data has made theoretical explanations for the syrinx difficult to reconcile. In order to understand the complex pressure environment, four simplified in vitro models were constructed to have anatomical similarities with post-traumatic SM and Chiari malformation related SM. Experimental geometry and properties were based on in vivo data and incorporated pertinent elements such as a realistic CSF flow waveform, spinal stenosis, syrinx, flexible SC, and flexible spinal column. The presence of a spinal stenosis in the SAS caused peak-to-peak cerebrospinal fluid CSF pressure fluctuations to increase rostral to the stenosis. Pressure with both stenosis and syrinx present was complex. Overall, the interaction of the syrinx and stenosis resulted in a diastolic valve mechanism and rostral tensioning of the SC. In all experiments, the blockage was shown to increase and dissociate SAS pressure, while the axial pressure distribution in the syrinx remained uniform. These results highlight the importance of the properties of the SC and spinal SAS, such as compliance and permeability, and provide data for comparison with computational models. Further research examining the influence of stenosis size and location, and the importance of tissue properties, is warranted.},

	abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS) have been thought to play an important pathophysiological role in syringomyelia, Chiari I malformation (CM), and a role in intrathecal drug delivery. Yet, the impact that fine anatomical structures, including nerve roots and denticulate ligaments (NRDL), have on SSS CSF dynamics is not clear. In the present study we assessed the impact of NRDL on CSF dynamics in the cervical SSS. The 3D geometry of the cervical SSS was reconstructed based on manual segmentation of MRI images of a healthy volunteer and a patient with CM. Idealized NRDL were designed and added to each of the geometries based on in vivo measurments in the literature and confirmation by a neuroanatomist. CFD simulations were performed for the healthy and patient case with and without NRDL included. Our results showed that the NRDL had an important impact on CSF dynamics in terms of velocity field and flow patterns. However, pressure distribution was not altered greatly although the NRDL cases required a larger pressure gradient to maintain the same flow. Also, the NRDL did not alter CSF dynamics to a great degree in the SSS from the foramen magnum to the C1 level for the healthy subject and CM patient with mild tonsillar herniation (∼6 mm). Overall, the NRDL increased fluid mixing phenomena and resulted in a more complex flow field. Comparison of the streamlines of CSF flow revealed that the presence of NRDL lead to the formation of vortical structures and remarkably increased the local mixing of the CSF throughout the SSS.},

	abstract = {Objective – Hydrocephalus is much more complex than a simple disorder of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation. Shunting primarily corrects disturbed fluid flow which may have an impact on cerebral blood flow and metabolism. We studied hydrocephalic patients before and after shunting to characterize changes in their CSF compensatory parameters. Material and methods – We selected 25 patients and studied them retrospectively. All patients had ventriculomegaly and clinical symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus. After shunting, they were still presenting with some adverse symptoms, mainly headaches, slow improvement or no improvement of ventriculomegaly. Therefore, they underwent further infusion studies to assess shunt function. In all cases, the shunts were confirmed to be draining CSF adequately. Parameters of CSF dynamics: baseline intracranial pressure (ICP), resistance to CSF outflow, cerebrospinal elasticity, content of vasogenic pressure waves (pulse, respiratory and B waves) and compensatory reserve assessed as moving correlation coefficient between mean CSF pressure and pulse amplitude (RAP), were compared before and after shunting. Results – Mean ICP and resistance to CSF outflow decreased (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.003) after shunting. All vasogenic pressure waves decreased (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.005). Compensatory reserve (RAP) significantly improved (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.005). Conclusion – A functioning shunt has an important impact on CSF circulation and pressure–volume compensation. Infusion studies can demonstrate the return of disturbed CSF dynamics to normal values even if clinical or radiological changes are not dramatic.},

This study investigated the contribution of established CSF dynamic parameters to AMPmean, a prognostic variable defined as mean amplitude of cardiac-related intracranial pressure pulsations during 10 min of lumbar constant infusion, with the aim of clarifying the physiological interpretation of the variable. AMPmean and CSF dynamic parameters were determined from infusion tests performed on 18 patients with suspected NPH. Using a mathematical model of CSF dynamics, an expression for AMPmean was derived and the influence of the different parameters was assessed. There was high correlation between modelled and measured AMPmean (r = 0.98, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). Outflow resistance and three parameters relating to compliance were identified from the model. Correlation analysis of patient data confirmed the effect of the parameters on AMPmean (Spearman’s ρ = 0.58–0.88, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Simulated variations of ±1 standard deviation (SD) of the parameters resulted in AMPmean changes of 0.6–2.9 SD, with the elastance coefficient showing the strongest influence. Parameters relating to compliance showed the largest contribution to AMPmean, which supports the importance of the compliance aspect of CSF dynamics for the understanding of the pathophysiology of NPH.},

We examined the ultrastructure of spinal meninges from three human cadavers immediately after death to see whether there is a virtual subdural space at this level. The arachnoid mater had two portions: a compact laminar portion covering the dural sac internal surface and a trabecular portion extending like a spider web around the pia mater. There was a cellular interface between the laminar arachnoid and the internal layer of the dura that we called the dura-arachnoid interface. There was no subdural space in those specimens where the dura mater was macroscopically in continuity with the arachnoid trabecules. In the specimens where the dura mater was separated from the arachnoid, we found fissures in between the neurothelial cells that extended throughout the interface. We hypothesize that the subdural space would have its origin within the dura-arachnoid interface when the neurothelial cells break up, creating in this way a real subdural space.},

	abstract = {Numerous mathematical models have emerged in the medical literature over the past two decades attempting to characterize the pressure and volume dynamics of the central nervous system compartment. These models have been used to study the behavior of this compartment under such pathological clinical conditions as hydrocephalus, head injury and brain edema. The number of different approaches has led to considerable confusion regarding the validity, accuracy or appropriateness of the various models. In this paper we review the mathematical basis for these models in a simplified fashion, leaving the mathematical details to appendices. We show that most previous models are in fact particular cases of a single basic differential equation describing the evolution in time of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CFS). Central to this approach is the hypothesis that the rate of change of CSF volume with respect to pressure is a measure of the compliance of the brain tissue which as a consequence leads to particular models depending on the form of the compliance function. All such models in fact give essentially no information on the behavior of the brain itself. More recent models (solved numerically using the Finite Element Method) have begun to address this issue but have difficulties due to the lack of information about the mechanical properties of the brain. Suggestions are made on how development of models which account for these mechanical properties might be developed.},

The goal of this study was to measure CSF velocities at multiple cervical spinal levels in patients with Chiari I malformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a patient registry, consecutive patients without surgery who had PCMR flow images in 5–8 axial planes between the foramen magnum and C4 were identified. Four contiguous regions were defined from the foramen magnum to C4. In each region, the fastest positive flow (PSV) and fastest negative flow (PDV) were tabulated. Changes in peak velocity by cervical spinal level and age and sex were tested for significance with linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In 17 patients studied, PSV increased progressively and significantly from the foramen magnum to C4. PDVs increased slightly from the foramen magnum to C3. The changes in velocity over the 4 regions tended to be smaller in the 13 patients with tonsilar ectopia than in the 4 patients without it. Age and sex had an effect on peak velocities. CONCLUSIONS: Peak diastolic and systolic CSF velocities are significantly greater below than at the foramen magnum.},

We extended previous simulation studies by including cyclic CSF flow and patient-specific models in multiple patients with Chiari I. We compared simulation results with MR flow measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volumetric high resolution image sets acquired in 7 patients with Chiari I, 3 patients who had previous craniovertebral decompression, and 3 controls were segmented and converted to mathematical models of the subarachnoid space. CSF flow velocities and pressures were calculated with high spatial and temporal resolution during simulated oscillatory flow in each model with the Navier-Stokes equations. Pressures, velocities, and bidirectional flow were compared in the groups (with Student t test). Peak velocities in the simulations were compared with peak velocities measured in vivo with PCMR. RESULTS: Flow visualization for patients and volunteers demonstrated nonuniform reversing patterns resembling those observed with PCMR. Velocities in the 13 subjects were greater between C2 and C5 than in the foramen magnum. Chiari patients had significantly greater peak systolic and diastolic velocities, synchronous bidirectional flow, and pressure gradients than controls. Peak velocities measured in PCMR correlated significantly (P = .003; regression analysis) despite differences between them. CONCLUSIONS: In simulations of CSF, patients with Chiari I had significantly greater peak systolic and diastolic velocities, synchronous bidirectional flow, and pressure gradients than controls.},

In lumped-parameter mathematical models of the intracranial system, local compliance parameters relate volume adjustments to dynamic changes in pressure differences between adjacent model subunits. This work explores the relationship between the forms used for local model compliances and the calculated global pressure-volume relationship. It is shown that the experimentally-measured global relationship can be recovered using physiologically motivated expressions for the local compliances at the interfaces between the venous-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) subunits and arterial-CSF subunits in the model. Establishment of a consistent link between local model compliances and the physiological bulk pressure-volume relationship is essential if lumped-parameter models are to be capable of realistically predicting intracranial pressure dynamics.},

	abstract = {Cine-phase-contrast-MRI was used to measure the three-dimensional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow field inside the central nervous system (CNS) of a healthy subject. Image reconstruction and grid generation tools were then used to develop a three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction model of the CSF flow inside the CNS. The CSF spaces were discretized using the finite-element method and the constitutive equations for fluid and solid motion solved in ADINA-FSI 8.6. Model predictions of CSF velocity magnitude and stroke volume were found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. CSF pressure gradients and amplitudes were computed in all regions of the CNS. The computed pressure gradients and amplitudes closely match values obtained clinically. The highest pressure amplitude of 77 Pa was predicted to occur in the lateral ventricles. The pressure gradient between the lateral ventricles and the lumbar region of the spinal canal did not exceed 132 Pa ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde1 mmHg) at any time during the cardiac cycle. The pressure wave speed in the spinal canal was predicted and found to agree closely with values previously reported in the literature. Finally, the forward and backward motion of the CSF in the ventricles was visualized, revealing the complex mixing patterns in the CSF spaces. The mathematical model presented in this article is a prerequisite for developing a mechanistic understanding of the relationships among vasculature pulsations, CSF flow, and CSF pressure waves in the CNS.},

	abstract = {The effective treatment of brain diseases, such as malignant brain tumours, is generally constricted by the controlled contribution of therapeutic agents. Novel brain tumour therapy proceeds from a direct infusion of the drug into the extra-vascular space of the nervous brain tissue (convection-enhanced delivery). This is carried out using catheter to bypass the blood-brain barrier, which effectively separates brain tissue from the intra-vascular space and hence hamper drug delivery through the bloodstream. The dilation of the target tissue, as response to the local pressure increase, initiates interstitial fluid flow and, thus, the distribution of the chemical agents. An adequate constitutive model of the complex tissue aggregate in the framework of the Theory of Porous Media is essential in order to assist modern clinical application via numerical simulations. The presented model consists of an elastically deformable solid skeleton, provided by the tissue cells, permeated by two viscous, materially incompressible pore-liquid phases, interstitial fluid and blood plasma. Both liquids are mobile within the solid skeleton and separated from each other. With regard to simulate a drug infusion process in the extra-vascular space, the interstitial fluid is treated as a solution of a liquid solvent and a dissolved therapeutic solute. The constitutive assumptions for the involved constituents are adjusted in order to describe the physical behaviour of human brain tissue. The presented numerical examples illustrate the fundamental effects during an infusion process. Therefore, the resulting set of coupled partial differential equations is spatially discretised using hexahedral mixed finite elements with an implicit (backward) Euler time integration scheme to solve the considered problem in a monolithic manner for the primary variables.

	abstract = {The maintenance of adequate blood flow to the brain is critical for normal brain function; cerebral blood flow, its regulation and the effect of alteration in this flow with disease have been studied extensively and are very well understood. This flow is not steady, however; the systolic increase in blood pressure over the cardiac cycle causes regular variations in blood flow into and throughout the brain that are synchronous with the heart beat. Because the brain is contained within the fixed skull, these pulsations in flow and pressure are in turn transferred into brain tissue and all of the fluids contained therein including cerebrospinal fluid. While intracranial pulsatility has not been a primary focus of the clinical community, considerable data have accrued over the last sixty years and new applications are emerging to this day. Investigators have found it a useful marker in certain diseases, particularly in hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury where large changes in intracranial pressure and in the biomechanical properties of the brain can lead to significant changes in pressure and flow pulsatility. In this work, we review the history of intracranial pulsatility beginning with its discovery and early characterization, consider the specific technologies such as transcranial Doppler and phase contrast MRI used to assess various aspects of brain pulsations, and examine the experimental and clinical studies which have used pulsatility to better understand brain function in health and with disease.},

	abstract = {SummaryCerebrospinal fluid pulsation is likely to be responsible for the progression of some diseases, and it is differences in pressure which are significant in causing the imposition of energy upon tissues. The normal range of such differences has not been extensively documented. A technique for measuring intracranial and intraspinal pressures simultaneously in erect conscious patients is described. Normally the pressures are in a continual state of pulsation in response to changes in pressure in the arteries and veins. The measurements of CSF pressure fluctuations in response to normal cardiac pulsation, respiratory changes, coughing, Queckenstedt's test, and a variation of Valsalva's manoeuvre have been recorded, and the physiology has been discussed.},

	abstract = {Purpose To develop quantitative MRI techniques to measure, model, and visualize cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics in normal subjects and hydrocephalic patients. Materials and Methods Velocity information was obtained using time-resolved (CINE) phase-contrast imaging of different brain regions. A technique was developed to measure the change of lateral ventricle (LV) size. The temporal relationships between the LV size change, CSF movement, and blood flow could then be established. The data were incorporated into a first-principle CSF hydrodynamic model. The model was then used to generate specific predictions about CSF pressure relationships. To better-visualize the CSF flow, a color-coding technique based on linear transformations was developed that represents the magnitude and direction of the velocity in a single cinematic view. Results The LV volume change of the eight normal subjects was 0.901 ± 0.406\%. Counterintuitively, the LV decreases as the choroid plexus expands, so that they act together to produce the CSF oscillatory flow. The amount of oscillatory flow volume is 21.7 ± 10.6\% of the volume change of the LV from its maximum to its minimum. Conclusion The quantification and visualization techniques, together with the mathematical model, provide a unique approach to understanding CSF flow dynamics. J. Magn. Reson.

Alternate theories postulating that a possible movement of the brain is involved in pumping CSF have not, to the authors' knowledge, been substantiated heretofore. In this study, in vivo, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods were developed to show reproducible magnitudes and directions of CSF flow. Measurements were obtained with a new MR velocity imaging technique at high resolution (0.4 mm/sec), requiring 64 cardiac cycles per image. Twenty-five healthy volunteers and five patients were studied. Observations of pulsatile brain motion, ejection of CSF out of the cerebral ventricles, and simultaneous reversal of CSF flow direction in the basal cisterns toward the spinal canal, taken together, suggest that a vascular-driven movement of the entire brain may be directly pumping the CSF circulation. The authors describe what they believe to be the first observations and measurements of human brain motion, which occurs in extensive internal regions (particularly the diencephalon and brain stem) and is synchronous with cardiac systole.},

Phase contrast cine MR sequences were performed in sagittal and axial planes on 13 volunteers with flow encoding in the craniocaudal direction. CSF pulsations displayed considerable variations in healthy subjects, depending both on measurements localization and subjects, with CSF peak velocities ranging from 0 to 7 cm/s. In the subarachnoid spaces, the highest velocities occurred in the anterior location and increased from the cerebellar pontine angle cisterns towards the lower cervical spaces. In the ventricular system, the highest velocities occurred through the aqueduct of Sylvius. CSF flow within the third ventricle seemed to reflect a circular motion. There was a caudal net CSF flow in the aqueduct whereas in the upper cervical spaces net CSF flow was caudal anteriorly and cranial laterally. Velocity profiles of CSF pulsations demonstrated arterial morphology. After the R wave, caudal systolic motion was first observed in the posterior subarachnoid spaces, soon after in the anterior subarachnoid spaces and later in the ventricular system. Considering the morphology of CSF pathways, three successively initiated phenomena may explain the temporal course of CSF motion: the systolic expansion of the main arteries at the base of the brain, the systolic expansion of the cerebrospinal axis and, finally, the systolic expansion of the choroid plexuses.},

We examined 12 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH; pseudotumour cerebri), and 10 healthy volunteers. The peak caudal and rostral CSF flow in the aqueduct during the cardiac cycle did not differ significantly between the patients and the volunteers. A significant correlation was found between the CSF volume flow amplitude and the resistance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow in the patients (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). The calculated mean supratentorial CSF production rate was 0.79 ml/min in the patients and 0.70 ml/min in the controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, the MRI measurements suggested CSF hypersecretion in three patients, whereas increased transependymal passage of CSF could have been the cause of negative calculated CSF production rates in two others. A tendency towards lower mean blood flow in the SSS (mean 345 ml/min) in the patients than in the controls (mean 457 ml/min) was found, and in two patients showed very low values.

	abstract = {The mechanisms previously proposed for the progression of syringomyelia associated with Chiari I malformation of the cerebellar tonsils are controversial, leave many clinical observations unexplained, and underlie the prevalence of different operations currently used as initial treatment. To explore the mechanism of syringomyelia progression in this setting, the authors used anatomical and dynamic (phase-contrast and phase-contrast cine) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and intraoperative ultrasonography to examine the anatomy and dynamics of movement of the cerebellar tonsils, the wall of the spinal cord surrounding the syrinx, and the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and syrinx fluid at rest, during the respiratory and cardiac cycles, and during Valsalva maneuver in seven affected patients. In all patients the cerebellar tonsils occluded the subarachnoid space at the level of the foramen magnum. Syringomyelia extended from the cervical to the lower thoracic segment of the spinal cord. No patient had evidence of a patent communication between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx on anatomical MR images, dynamic MR images, or intraoperative ultrasound studies. Dynamic MR images of three patients revealed abrupt downward movement of the spinal CSF and the syrinx fluid during systole and upward movement during diastole, but limited movement of CSF across the foramen magnum during the cardiac cycle. Intraoperative ultrasound studies demonstrated abrupt downward movement of the cerebellar tonsils during systole that was synchronous with sudden constriction of the spinal cord and syrinx. Decompression of the foramen magnum was achieved via suboccipital craniectomy, laminectomy of C-1 and C-2, and dural grafting, leaving the arachnoid intact. Immediately after surgery, the pulsatile downward thrust of the tonsils and constriction of the spinal cord and syrinx disappeared. Syringomyelia resolved within 1 to 6 months after surgery in all patients. Observations by the authors suggest the following previously unrecognized mechanism for progression of syringomyelia associated with occlusion of the subarachnoid space at the foramen magnum. The brain expands as it fills with blood during systole, imparting a systolic pressure wave to the intracranial CSF that is accommodated in normal subjects by sudden movement of CSF from the basal cisterns to the upper portion of the spinal canal. With obstruction to rapid movement of CSF at the foramen magnum, the cerebellar tonsils, which plug the subarachnoid space posteriorly, move downward with each systolic pulse, acting as a piston on the partially isolated spinal CSF and producing a systolic pressure wave in the spinal CSF that acts on the surface of the spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	volume = {99},
	issn = {0006-8950},
	abstract = {CSF pressure recordings have been taken from the lumbar region and the cisterna magna of 16 patients during coughing in the sitting position. Isolated coughs of low amplitude have been studied. The lumbar pressure waves occur sooner and lower. Thus there is a phase during which the lumbar pressure exceeds the cisternal, followed by one in which the cisternal exceeds the lumbar. These phenomena may be conveniently displayed on a differential trace. The phase during which the cisternal pressure exceeds the lumbar may be protracted. It is suggested that Froin's syndrome, central subarachnoid pouches and syringobulbia may be associated with upward pressure waves. Cough headache, the filling stages of communicating syringomyelia and tonsillar herniation may be associated with valve-like blockage at the foramen magnum which produces craniospinal pressure dissociation by interfering with downward or rebound pulsation. Decompensation of hydrocephalus after birth may be related to pulsation in association with crying; also after removal of a meningocele sac decompensation may be related to the effects of similar pulsation modified by changes in capacitance following operation. The cord destruction of syringomyelia, and the mechanisms which fill spinal subarachnoid cysts may be related to pressure waves directed both upwards and downwards. The merits and limitations of cough impulse as a clinical test for spinal blockage are discussed, and the suggestion is made that after further evaluation they may provide a more sensitive indication of spinal blockage than Queckenstedt's test.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cardiac-gated phase-contrast MR technique was used to acquire images at 14 time points evenly spaced through the cardiac cycle in 10 volunteers and eight patients with Chiari I malformation. Instantaneous CSF velocities were displayed as temporal and spatial plots and examined for homogeneity, differences between flow anterior and flow posterior to the spinal cord, synchronous bidirectional flow, and equivalence of the caudad flow and craniad flow in each voxel. Indexes for flow homogeneity, synchronous bidirectional flow, and preferential flow direction were calculated, and differences between the patient and volunteer groups were tested for significance with a t test of the means. RESULTS: In volunteers, diastolic velocity peaked in two regions in the anterior paramedial subarachnoid space. Patients had greater inhomogeneity of flow than volunteers. They had substantially increased flow (jets) in the anterior paramedial locations. Synchronous bidirectional flow was seen in six of the patients and in none of the volunteers. Cephalad flow in the jets or nodes (P = .05), proportion of cephalad and caudad flow in the anterior compartment (P {\textless} .005 for both), and the fraction of voxels with flow directionality (P = .03) differed significantly between patients and volunteers. CONCLUSION: CSF flow in symptomatic patients with Chiari I malformation, unlike that in volunteer subjects, is characterized by flow jets, regions with a preponderance of flow in one direction, and synchronous bidirectional flow. © RSNA, 2004},

	abstract = {More than a quarter of patients with spinal cord injury develop syringomyelia, often with progressive neurological deficit. Treatment options remain limited and long-term failure rates are high. The current poor understanding is impeding development of improved therapies. The source and route of fluid flow into syringes has been investigated using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracers. Previous work using a model of canalicular syringomyelia has shown that fluid enters the dilated central canal from perivascular spaces. The aim of this study was to determine the source and route of fluid flow in an animal model of extracanalicular (post-traumatic) syringomyelia. A model of post-traumatic syringomyelia was established in 25 Sprague-Dawley rats with intraparenchymal injections of quisqualic acid and kaolin-induced arachnoiditis. Rats survived for 6 weeks before injection of the CSF tracer horseradish peroxidase into the cisterna magna. Examination of the spatial distribution of horseradish peroxidase at 0, 3, 5, 10, or 20 min after injection was used to determine the route of fluid flow. Horseradish peroxidase rapidly spread to the ventromedian fissure, perivascular spaces, central canal, and extracanalicular syrinx. Flow occurred into the syrinx prior to significant perivascular flow in the rostral spinal cord. Preferential flow into the syrinx occurred from the perivascular spaces of the central penetrating branches of the anterior spinal artery in the grey matter. Transparenchymal flow into the syrinx was less prominent than perivascular flow. This is the first report of fluid flow within the spinal cord in a model of post-traumatic syringomyelia. Fluid from perivascular spaces moves preferentially into extracanalicular syringes and the surrounding parenchyma. Obstruction to CSF flow and loss of compliance from traumatic arachnoiditis might potentiate fluid flow in the perivascular space.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite many hypotheses, the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still not well understood. In this report, the authors propose a hypothesis based on analysis of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the spine.
METHODS: An electric circuit model of the CSF dynamics of the spine was constructed based on a technique of computational fluid mechanics. With this model, the authors calculated how a pulsatile CSF wave coming from the cranial side is propagated along the spinal cord.
RESULTS: Reducing the temporary fluid storage capacity of the cisterna magna dramatically increased the pressure wave propagated along the central canal. The peak of this pressure wave resided in the mid-portion of the spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: The following hypotheses are proposed. The cisterna magna functions as a shock absorber against the pulsatile CSF waves coming from the cranial side. The loss of shock absorbing capacity of the cisterna magna and subsequent increase of central canal wall pressure leads to syrinx formation in patients with Chiari I malformation.},

	abstract = {Hydrocephalus is not always caused by blockage in absorption; it can result from an imbalance in cardiac impulse distribution that can cause a ventriculomegaly in chronic communicating hydrocephalus. Chronic ventriculomegaly may result in cardiac dysfunction, which may beget a pathophysiologic cycle in the elderly. The CSF spaces play a critical role in cardiac impulse absorption: cerebral blood flow may be diminished in CSF disease and enhanced by its manipulation. The interface between the CSF circulatory system and cardiovascular system is based on certain organizing principles, at least one of which appears to be the control and regulation of cardiac impulses that are reaching the brain tissue.},
